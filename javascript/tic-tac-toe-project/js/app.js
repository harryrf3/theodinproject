1. Decide which player goes first.

2. On each turn, the player places their symbol ("X" or "O") on an empty square of the grid.

3. After each turn, check if the game is over:

If there are three symbols in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, the game is over, and the player with the three symbols wins.

If there are no more empty squares on the grid, the game is over, and the result is a tie.

4. If the game is not over, switch to the other player and repeat steps 2-3.

5. If the game is over, display the winner or the tie result.

6. Ask the players if they want to play again. If they do, reset the grid and start over from step 2. If they don't, end the game.
